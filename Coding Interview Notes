# There's a sticker vending machine that prints out stickers with the full word "WP Engine" on them.
# You will need to write a function that accepts an argument, a word, to determine how many stickers will need to be purchased in order to spell that word (not case sensitive).
# The letters from the sticker can be re-arranged in any particular order.
# You can think of this as physically cutting out each of the letters and using them to spell the word.
# Examples: (WINNING {2}, PINGING {2}, WWW {3}, and NINE {1} for example words)
